Pickpock - frontend project

# Brief description about PickPock
Most people are very busy with their jobs, family and friends, and other important activities, which doesn't leave much time for shopping. We want to solve this problem by using an AI-centric approach. Users can use our app to select products from brands which they like and dislike, and our AI algorithm will create a custom and individual monthly boxes just for you. But we don't stop there. We partner with popular brands and other electronic shopping partners to actually deliver all the boxes in selected cities. All this will be packed up in a monthly subscription, where users can choose between different plans.
