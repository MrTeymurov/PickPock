# PickPock

Pickpock - frontend project.
Please be aware this is the non-responsive website. Responsive version is under development.

## Overview

Most people are very busy with their jobs, families, friends, and other important activities, which doesn't leave much time for shopping. I want to solve this problem by using an AI-centric approach. Users can use this app to select products from brands they like and dislike, and an AI algorithm will create a custom and individual monthly box just for them. But we don't stop there. We partner with popular brands and other electronic shopping partners to actually deliver all the boxes in selected cities. All this will be packed up in a monthly subscription, where users can choose between different plans.
